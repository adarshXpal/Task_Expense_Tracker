# 💸 Task Expense Tracker (Remix App)

A simple, clean expense tracking app built using [Remix](https://remix.run/) and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete daily expenses, with all data stored in a JSON file.

## 🧑‍💻 My Approach

I followed the assignment structure closely and built this project using:

- **Remix file-based routing** for all core routes: `/`, `/add`, `/edit/:id`, and `/delete/:id`
- **Loaders and actions** to handle data fetch and mutation the Remix way
- A **JSON file** as a lightweight, mock database to simulate storage
- **Tailwind CSS** for a fully responsive, modern UI
- **Client-side + server-side validation** for safe form handling
- Polished the UI for better user experience with confirmation prompts and styled buttons
